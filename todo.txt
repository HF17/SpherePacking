main plan ideas:
step 1:
    generate a poisson point process

step 2:
    find a good independet set inside the point process

step 3:
    transform the independet set by moving the centers around to try to get a better IS, still without 
    overlap but hopefully with enough space for 1 extra sphere

step 4:
    if there is enough room add a new sphere. We could also try to add a sphere with overlap and see
    if the model can fix it

idea for diffusion model:
    - 1 configuration of sphere packings can be better than another packing eventhough the have the
    same number of sphere. Because one of these configuration might have enough room for another sphere -
    Samehow our loss function must measure this "enough room for another sphere" attribute. 
    maybe by using some local density

- VAE to generate new independet sets. If they cover more space than the previous best we can collect
new training input data



28.02 steps:
1 - estimation upper bound number of spheres using the table. Call it optimal_number. Compare for lower_bound to see 
    how big the bounding box has to be.
2 - Construct many good sphere packings. For example using luby on 10*optimal_number spheres
3 - A diffusion model with can take a varying number of points as input. Train on data on inference on optimal_number+1 spheres,
    that is add one sphere extra.
4 - Test other models (VAR, GNN, Unet in POintnet)
